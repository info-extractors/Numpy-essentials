# NumPy Fundamentals

Welcome to the **NumPy Fundamentals** repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring the core concepts of NumPy, the powerful numerical computing library for Python. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, this repository provides insights into NumPy arrays, operations, and best practices.

## 📌 About
This repository covers:
- Introduction to NumPy
- Creating and manipulating NumPy arrays
- Indexing and slicing
- Mathematical operations with NumPy
- Broadcasting
- Linear algebra functions
- Performance optimization with NumPy

## 🛠 Installation
To use NumPy, you need to install it first. You can do so with:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
Or if you are using Anaconda:
```bash
conda install numpy
```

## 📚 Topics Covered
- **NumPy Arrays**: Creating arrays, different data types, and reshaping
- **Array Operations**: Arithmetic, logical, and statistical functions

- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations and solving equations
- **Performance Optimization**: Speeding up computations with NumPy

## 🚀 Usage
You can import NumPy and start using it as follows:
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```
